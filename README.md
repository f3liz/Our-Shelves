## Project Overview  

Our Shelves is a low-stress space to visually track books you are reading and leave “sticky notes” in each book with page numbers, tracking progress with a bookmark. Friends can view your shelf and, if they are reading the same book, share notes.  

**Example:**  
John Doe is on page 57 of *The Great Gatsby* and writes “I can’t believe he said that!” Jane Doe is on page 130 and writes “Oh no!” John can see that Jane left a note on page 130 and can choose to read it or wait until he’s caught up.  

**Problem Statement:**  
Readers want a way to track reading and share reactions without committing to a full social network.  

**Target Users:**  
People who like to track their reading progress and share thoughts selectively with friends.
